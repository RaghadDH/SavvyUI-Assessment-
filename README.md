# Savvy Gaming Group â€“ Tech UI Internship (2025)

## About the Project

This project is for the Savvy Gaming Group Kickstarter Internship UI Technical Track. They gave me an image to recreate in Unity.

1-I made three buttons:
  * Play
  * Settings
  * Quit
2- I cut the button images in Photoshop and saved them as PNGs.
* The background image is from open sources.
* I used Unity UI Canvas to build everything.
* I added:
  Hover effects
  One idle animation for the Intro to Unity UI Button that makes the buttons scale a bit
  The UI works in portrait and landscape screens.

## Above & Beyond (Optional)

* Implemented **Safe Area** support to ensure UI elements do not overlap with phone camera notches or rounded screen edges.  
  I used a free, ready-made Unity script available online From unity website for handling Safe Area adjustments.  
  This guarantees the UI displays correctly across various devices, including newer phones with notches.

* Bonus: Prepared to animate **Hover Element 2** for additional UI interactivity if required.

## How to Run

* Open the Unity project called `SavvyUI - Assessment` 
* Open the scene file `MainScene.unity`.
* Press Play to test the UI.
